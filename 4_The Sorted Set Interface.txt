The Sorted Set Interface

The Sorted Set interface extends Set and declares the behavior of a set sorted in ascending order. In addition to those methods defined by Set, the Sorted Set interface declares the method.

It includes the following methods:

Comparator comparator( )
Returns the invoking sorted set's comparator. If the natural ordering is used for this set, null is returned.

Object first( )
Returns the first element in the invoking sorted set.

SortedSet headSet(Object end)
Returns a SortedSet containing those elements less than end that are contained in the invoking sorted set. Elements in the returned sorted set are also referenced by the invoking sorted set.

Object last( )
Returns the last element in the invoking sorted set.

SortedSet subSet(Object start, Object end)
Returns a SortedSet that includes those elements between start and end.1. Elements in the returned collection are also referenced by the invoking object.

SortedSet tailSet(Object start)
Returns a SortedSet that contains those elements greater than or equal to start that are contained in the sorted set. Elements in the returned set are also referenced by the invoking object.
