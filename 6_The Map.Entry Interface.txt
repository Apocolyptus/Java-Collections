The Map.Entry Interface

The Map.Entry interface enables you to work with a map entry. The entrySet( ) method declared by the Map interface returns a Set containing the map entries. Each of these set elements is a Map.Entry object.

It includes the following methods:

boolean equals(Object obj)
Returns true if obj is a Map.Entry whose key and value are equal to that of the invoking object

Object getKey( )
Returns the key for this map entry

Object getValue( )
Returns the value for this map entry

int hashCode( )
Returns the hash code for this map entry

Object setValue(Object v)
Sets the value for this map entry to v. A ClassCastException is thrown if v is not the correct type for the map. A NullPointerException is thrown if v is null and the map does not permit null keys. An UnsupportedOperationException is thrown if the map cannot be changed
