The Enumeration Interface

The Enumeration interface defines the methods by which you can enumerate (obtain one at a time) the elements in a collection of objects. This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator. Although not deprecated, Enumeration is considered obsolete for new code. However, it is used by several methods defined by the legacy classes such as Vector and Properties, is used by several other API classes, and is currently in widespread use in application code.

It includes the following methods:

boolean hasMoreElements( )
When implemented, it must return true while there are still more elements to extract, and false when all the elements have been enumerated

Object nextElement( )
This returns the next object in the enumeration as a generic Object reference
