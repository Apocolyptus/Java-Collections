The SortedMap Interface

The SortedMap interface extends Map. It ensures that the entries are maintained in ascending key order. Several methods throw a NoSuchElementException when no items are in the invoking map. A ClassCastException is thrown when an object is incompatible with the elements in a map. A NullPointerException is thrown if an attempt is made to use a null object when null is not allowed in the map.

It includes the following methods:

Comparator comparator( )
Returns the invoking sorted map's comparator. If the natural ordering is used for the invoking map, null is returned

Object firstKey( )
Returns the first key in the invoking map

SortedMap headMap(Object end)
Returns a sorted map for those map entries with keys that are less than end

Object lastKey( )
Returns the last key in the invoking map

SortedMap subMap(Object start, Object end)
Returns a map containing those entries with keys that are greater than or equal to start and less than end

SortedMap tailMap(Object start)
Returns a map containing those entries with keys that are greater than or equal to start
